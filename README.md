# Family Tree

A client side visualization tool for family trees obtained from Turkish e-Government "alt soy - üst soy sorgulama" pages.

After displaying your family tree in a tabular form at the e-Government page, copy the whole content of the page in any browser and paste it into the given text box.

## Technical Info

Uses Raphäeljs for visualization. 

I'm not very fluent in Javascript, so don't be surprised if you see some awkward methods of doing things which are really easy with a different method.

## TODOs & Bugs & Known Issues 

1. General look and feel
2. Save as svg &rarr; Dashed boxes and redrawing instead of modifying the original raphael
3. Avoid line passing on top of shapes (other spouses)
4. Drawing or downloading multiple times causes the everything to be redrawn.
