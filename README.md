A client side visualization tool for family trees obtained from Turkish e-Government "alt soy - üst soy sorgulama" pages.

After displaying your family tree in a tabular form at the e-Government page, copy the whole content of the page in any browser and paste it into the given text box.

## Bugs / Known Issues 

1. General look and feel
