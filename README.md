# Family Tree

A client side visualization tool for family trees obtained from Turkish e-Government "alt soy - üst soy sorgulama" pages.

After displaying your family tree in a tabular form at the e-Government page, copy the whole content of the page in any browser and paste it into the given text box.

## Technical Info

Uses Raphaëljs for visualization. 

I'm not very fluent in Javascript, so don't be surprised if you see some awkward methods of doing things which are really easy with a different method.

## Deployment Preparation
Call "grunt" at the terminal. It uglifies all css and js and then replaces the original references at the project with the uglified ones.
